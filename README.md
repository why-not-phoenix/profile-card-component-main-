## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Learned a nice way to position background based on viewport to make it responsive.

```css
body {
  background-position: right 52vw bottom 35vh, left 47vw top 50vh;
}
```

### Continued development

- Generally need to work on my decision making and ways I can go about solving things. Particularly had an issue trying to make the profile picture responsive because I made it positioned absolute when all I really needed to do was give it a negative margin.

### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://convertingcolors.com/) - This helped me to easily convert hgb to hexcode. Used it to get a more websafe color format.
- [Color About](https://www.colorabout.com/) - This is just another site I used that helped with same thing.
